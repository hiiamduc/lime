Lime is a Javascript framework created in 2005. Further development was deemed unnecessary due to the superiority and magic of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

It contains a few interesting unique features such as AJAX HTTP event handlers, a built in debugging console that makes heavy use of introspection, and a mechanism for one-time "requiring" and importing of Javascript components.
